This project was created to mainly mock the look and some of the functionality provided by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

Currently, the Home, Explore, and Profile tabs are functional. These tabs attempt to closely replicate the functionality of the respective tabs on the actual Twitter site. For example, in the clone, a user can post a tweet from the home page, like/dislike the tweets, edit the user profile (currently the profile replicates Elon Musk's profile). The styling of the clone was built using Bootstrap and CSS. Data is stored and retrieved using MongoDB and mongoose. The backend uses Node.js and Express. The frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend is deployed using Heroku.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
